# Fintelics
As a React Developer at Toronto basesd company Fintelics, I had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects and collaborate with a talented team of designers, developers, and project managers.

One of my notable projects was to build a new dashboard application for our clients AXIA, which is a blockchain based banking system. This involved creating responsive UI components, integrating APIs, and building complex data visualization components. I worked closely with the design team to ensure that the user interface and user experience were intuitive and met our clients' needs.

In addition to my core development work, I also developed company's React-based design system. This involved creating reusable components, writing documentation, and collaborating with the design team to ensure that the design system was flexible and met the needs of our clients.

Throughout my time at Fintelics. I continually improved my skills in React, Redux, HTML5, CSS3 and related technologies. I regularly attended industry conferences and meetups, participated in internal code reviews, and collaborated with my colleagues to improve our development processes.
