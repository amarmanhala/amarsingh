       <p>My name is Amar, and I'm a Frontend engineer based in Toronto, Canada.  I have been working as developer for 4 years and have experience building scalable and responsive web applications using React.</p>
       <p className="mt-6">
       🧑‍💻 Previously, I worked at Fintelics, supporting Commerce Manager in which businesses like Nike manage Shops on Facebook and Instagram. I led the design effort behind 0-1 features that helped the company navigate the advertising signal loss, revenue diversification, and international expansion of e-commerce operations.
       </p>
       <p className="mt-6">
       🎓 With my MCA degree, I bring a strong foundation in computer science principles and a deep understanding of how they apply to web development. I have also had the opportunity to develop my programming, analytical and problem-solving skills, which have been invaluable in my work as a software engineer.


       </p>
       <p className="mt-6">
       🛠️ In addition to my education, I am proficient in React.js, Redux, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and related web technologies. I am familiar with tools like Bundlers (Parcel), Babel, ESLint, and Git for development and version control, and I am skilled in creating reusable components, optimizing app performance, and debugging code issues.
       </p>
       <p className="mt-6">
       🏅 Throughout my career, I have completed challenging projects, contributed to open-source React libraries, Design system and received recognition for my work.
       </p>
       <p className="mt-6">
       💡 From my experience in React development to my current exploration of AI and Swift, I am always eager to expand my skills and knowledge in the technology field.
       </p>
       <p className="mt-6">
       When I’m not coding, I like spending time with ☕️ Tea, 📸 taking photos of aesthetic things and 🏋️‍♀️ sporting activities.
